The . . . . . . CDO has a bunch of second lien positions 1n it that have been written down,
The collateral balance has fallen below the liabilities triggering an "implied write-down
event" which is a credit event in our CDS document.
Unlike RMBS structures, COOs do not
have a bond write-down feature.
On another note, today's RMBS downgrades by Moody's should cause many COOs to fail their
triggers. That will result in coupons being shut off on the bonds and hence our CDS
protection premi~ paid out will go to zero.

Moody's downgraded 32bb of of 2006 AA, A, BBB and BBB- bonds today. This will eventually
filter into downgrades 1n COOs. ABX single-As sold off by a point after the news.
ASS Desk P and L will be up between 30 and 35mm today,
12mm of the p and 1 is from our
first credit event in COOs where the implied trigger failed on a ~ deal ~
