Global Markets Daily: Potential Trends and Dislocations in EM FX
Summary: Retail sales and mortgage credit data shake markets. Risk assets come under
substantial pressure and rates rally. We have been stopped out of our short Jan 2017 TIPS
trade. We still think the sell-off is temporary and we are optimistic on EM FX. US
inflation data on Thursday and Friday could bring about short term volatility. If risk
aversion declines fast, outright long EM positions would benefit. A slower pick up in risk
appetite could benefit laggards like MXN, ZAR and IDR. A high US inflation print could
hurt currencies that have overshot like HUF (vs. EUR).

US Daily Comment: Mortgage Credit Quality Proble~ Go Well Beyond Subprime
Summary: New data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show that mortgage credit quality
problems go well beyond the sUbprime sector. This can be seen from the fact that
delinquencies on prime adjustable-rate mortgages are rising quickly -- much more quickly,
in fact, than those on subprime fixed-rate loans. According to our (very rough) estimates,
the credit quality of so-called 'teaser-rate' debt -- prime ARMs with very low initial
interest rates -- is deteriorating at pace that is similar to that of subprime ARMs. Since
teaser-rate ARMs typically have a longer reset schedule than subprime ARMs, this suggest
that the teaser-rate problem could ultimately well exceed the subprime problem.

Asia Â£conomics Data Flash: China data: Solid retail sales growth in January-February
Summary: Retail sales growth kept a solid pace in the first two months of the year, at
14.7% year on year (yoy), compared with 14.6% yay in December. On a quarter-an-quarter
(gog); seasonally-adjusted; annualized basis, retail sales grew by 14.0% and 13.9% in
February and January respectively. Growth of retail sales in real terms was 12.8% yoy in
January-February, a notch higher than that in the same period last year (12.4% yoy) ,
signifying stronger growth in domestic demand this year. Looking forward, we expect retail
sales growth to remain strong amid robust income growth. During the NPC meeting recently,
the government reiterated its policy emphasis on promoting private consumption and raising
household incomes at the mid and low levels.
