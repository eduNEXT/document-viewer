Subject: Subprime opportunities
This weekend we are focused on the following:
(1) Accredited - will look at investment opportunity with Cerberus. GS team includes PIA,
IBD and Mortgages. Sounds like another group is considering injecting $400mm of
convertible prefferred capital into Accredited as early as mid-next week. Accredited needs
capital by end of week or it will trip covenants.
(2) Fremont - Gerry Ford looking, we will try to tag along and are trying to get Cerberus
included. Indicative bids for the company are due Monday. IBO and Mortgages.
(3) New Century - they are in worst shape, Cerberus is looking at something and may
include us, but we don't think there is much there. GS is considering making proposals on
buying/financing resids that could give them some cash and allow us to offfset EPD
(unsecured) claims they owe us.
Things are very preliminary, and if/when we get anything close to real we will reach out
to you,
We also continue to look at asset purchase opportunities - alone, with C-BASS, or maybe
with others.
