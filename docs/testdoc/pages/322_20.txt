For much of 2007, Goldman Sachs and most other market participants, economists and policy
makers believed that the credit crisis was contained to the subprime mortgage market. During
this period, the firm continued market making and underwriting activities in residential
mortgages, which resulted in an increase in prime and other residential mortgage exposure.
Unfortunately, in 2008, it became clear that these other asset classes were deteriorating as well.
For the fiscal year ending November 2008, although profitable overall, the deterioration of these
asset classes was a meaningful contributor to the firm‘s overall net loss of approximately $1.7
billion in residential mortgage-related products.
E. Increases in Value at Risk (VaR)
Throughout the course of our risk-reduction efforts starting in late 2006, the mortgage
department experienced periodic spikes in VaR, or ―Value at Risk.‖ VaR is a risk metric that
measures the potential loss in value of trading inventory due to adverse moves in the market over
a defined period of time. The key inputs to VaR are the size and type of positions in the
respective assets (both long and short) as well as the volatility of the underlying assets. Between
November 24, 2006 and February 23, 2007, daily VaR in the mortgage department increased
from $13 million to $85 million, predominantly from increases in volatility.26
Increases in VaR were the result of dramatic fluctuations in the mortgage market (which had a
corresponding effect on VaR), not an effort on the part of Goldman Sachs to take a large
directional bet on the subprime market. In fact, because of the volatility of the markets, the
increases in VaR occurred despite efforts by the firm to reduce our overall exposure to the
mortgage market.
In a February 14, 2007 e-mail, Dan Sparks wrote, ―Over var due to massive spike in subprime
volatility and we are working with bruce on that. Over limit on cre loan scenario list but will
correct next week with large securitization pricing. Over limit on cdo risk but that will adjust as
moving positions to desks. Bad week in subprime.‖27
A February 21, 2007 e-mail from Mr. Sparks to Jon Winkelried described the volatility in the
subprime market:
We are net short, but mostly in single name CDS and some tranched index vs the
some [sic] index longs. We are working to cover more, but liquidity makes it
tough. Volatility is causing our VAR numbers to grow dramatically.28
