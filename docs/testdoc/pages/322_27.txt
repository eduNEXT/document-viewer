Loans
Residuals
COO warehouse
Early Payment Defaults (EPDs)
Loan warehouse
FOllOW-Ups:
1. Reduce exposure, sell more ABX index outright, basis trade of index vs CDS too large
2. Distribute as much as possible on bonds created from new loan securitizations and clean previous positions
3. Sell some more resids
4. Mark the COO warehouse more regularly (had been policy to true-up quarterly) - will likely be weekly or more if
necessary
5. Stay focused on the credit of the originators we buy loans from and lend 10
6. Stay focused and aggressive on MLN (warehouse customer and originator we have EPDs to that is likely to fail)
7. Be ready for the good opportunities that are coming (keep powder dry and look around the market hard)
