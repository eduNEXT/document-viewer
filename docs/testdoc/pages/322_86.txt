And right now, I'd love nothing more than just curl in your arms, feel the warmth of your
skin and just stay there smiling for hours (with occasional - frequent- tender kisses ... ; )
Wake up slowly my love ...
Your chtite darling

Oh sweet heart, by just implying that you have a good feeling about coming over here,

I'M JUST THE HAPPIEST WOMAN ON EARTH!!!!!
I just went through 45 minutes of physical torture this morning, and as a result my little body is a
little worm-eaten, but it always makes me feel a little better during the day ... But reading your
email, knowing that I can hope to in a day not too far off, wake up in your arms every morning,
see the love of the whole world in your eyes and reciprocate it hundredfold, every day ... It' s a
last generation dose of amphetamines ! ; )
I ADORE YOU FAB,

Can't wait to whisper sweet words in your ears in a few hours ...

Interesting, I will give you more details in person on what we spoke about but the summary of
the US subprime business situation is that it is not too brilliant. .. According to Sparks, that
business is totally dead, and the poor little subprime borrowers will not last so long!!!
