China data: Solid retail sales growth in January-February Retail sales growth kept a
solid pace in the first two months of the year, at 14.7% year on year (yoy), compared with
14.6% yoy in December. On a quarter-on-quarter (goq); seasonally-adjusted; annualized
basis, retail sales grew by 14.0% and 13.9% in February and January respectively. Growth
of retail sales in real terms was 12.8% yay in January-February, a notch higher than that
in the same period last year (12.4% yoy), signifying stronger growth in domestic demand
this year. Looking forward, we expect retail sales growth to remain strong amid robust
income growth. During the NPC meeting recently, the government reiterated its policy
emphasis on promoting private consumption and raising household incomes at the mid and low
levels. Hong Liang Helen (Hong) Qiao Yu Song
