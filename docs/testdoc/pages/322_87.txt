All this is giving me ideas for my medium term future, insomuch as I do not intend to wait for
the complete explosion of the industry and the beginning of distressed trading, I think there
might be more interesting things to do in Europe...

I spoke about this this afternoon with Nartey, who naturally confirmed that 'he would love if!
were in London, which would greatly facilitate communication with New York and would push
the European sales force to concentrate on the risks of structured finance ... '
I need to go to London for at least a week in April, get a better sense for the opportunity,
but I am getting more and more convinced...
Gazillion kisses chtite puce, I don't want to give you false hopes but I have a good feeling; )
