Total Net Revenues for the Firm

As Lloyd Blankfein and Gary Cohn explained in a letter to shareholders on April 7, 2010, ―The
firm did not generate enormous net revenues or profits by betting against residential mortgagerelated products, as some have speculated; rather, our relatively early risk reduction resulted in
our losing less money than we otherwise would have when the residential housing market began
to deteriorate rapidly… Although Goldman Sachs held various positions in residential mortgagerelated products in 2007, our short positions were not a ‗bet against our clients.‘ Rather, they
served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to be in a position to make markets for
our clients while managing our risk within prescribed limits.‖30
