Over the last few months, our risk reduction program consisted of:
(1) selling index outright
(2) buying single name protection
(3) buying protection on super-senior portions of the BBB/BBB- index (40-100% of the index). We thought that the
correlation of tranches on the very thin BBB- index was higher than where the market implied. We sold around $3 billion
in the mid-30's bp range.
Today is the first day of tranched ABX trading (TABX). We are getting greater transparency on the super-senior layer.
The market is opening up in BBB-'s around +200bps. We currently have our trades from (3) above marked in the 100 bp
area.
That is good for us position-wise, bad for accounts who wrote that protection (MS Prop, Peleton, ACA, Harvard), but
could hurt our COO pipeline position as COOs will be harder to do.
ABX index pretty flat so far.
It's early.
