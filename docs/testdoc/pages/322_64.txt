Independent Price Verification

•

A dedicated group within Controllers performs an independent price verification of the mortgage inventory. The
team is highly specialized and has extensive experience in the valuation of mortgage related products

•

The investment in this team over the last several years has led to a significant reduction in the mortgage related
unverified cash inventory (Nov. 2004 unverified market value of $9.1 billion, reduced to JUly. 2007 unverified
market value of $2.7 billion). The close coordination of this team and desk management has ensured market
movements are reflected in pricing on a timely basis and at times has lead to the remarking of positions

•

The price verification results for the quarter ending 7/27/07 indicate that the mortgage inventory is marked
appropriately. The marks reflect decreased liquidity within the subprime market

•

Price verification analysis utilizes four core strategies:

Trade comparison

•

Utilizes a review of recent market transactions against inventory positions with similar collateral and/or risk
profiles and is an important determinant of market technicals or risk premium

Collateral analysis

•

Utilizes two way collateral agreements to review pricing by market counterparts for mortgage derivatives,
These agreements call for the posting of collateral against outstanding contracts when their mar1<et value
falls, The exchange of collateral margin against derivative transactions is a strong indicator of mar1<et levels
