RE: Trading VaR $165mm

The volatilities and correlations among our assets are really driving the swings in var
right now. Robert Berry sent out a note last night indicating that the sensitivity of our
var models to correlations suggests that the var can swing between 140 and 160 without any
changes in the comple~ion of our trading books - essentially, it is noise. The only
solution is to reduce the size of the books, which is what we are working on with
mortgages and credit trading. In credit trading, in Ram's book, we are long 1.1 dvOI by
short 3.4 dvOl. He is reducing his short by 550 dv01 today (in monolines, brokers and IG
index), and we are trying to figure out how much of his remaining short he needs against
other commitments he has which ARE NOT showing up on his long side. Don and I are meeting
with the mortgage guys today, and will share with you the plan in that book after its is
finalized,
