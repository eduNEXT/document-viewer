Focuses:
1. Square position in 88B-.
We made progress last week, but still more work to do. First focus on 2006 B88- and then on reducing index vs single
names basis. Below shows risk reduction trades Thursday and Friday (we also did $650mm notional of single name risk
reduction Wednesday). DV01 is between 3 and 3.2, so to get the 200S 888- DVOl to flat we need layoff about another
$1 billion notional.

Biggest concerns are (1) liquidity in last 2 weeks of Dec. and ability/motivation for certain hedge funds to shove market
either way with respect to year-end perlormance measures, and (2) noise in originator sector· more will go down (when
not if). Trading desk is looking 10 buy puts on a few originators.
2. Recognition and aggressiveness in residential whole loan and counter-party business.
Team making and receiving lull margin calls (except for MlN partial), team aggressively pursuing EPD claims and
seltlemenls, and team understanding not 10 rush into opportunities that are coming (e.g., we did not buy $SOOmm scratch
and dent package that had Friday first round bids because there is going to be a lot more coming).
3. COO warehouse marking.
Worked wilh controllers and slrals Friday to implement more frequent marks 10 COO warehouse. Methodology
conceptually agreed to, need some more time to implement. We took a $5mm reserve on Friday in P&l. Details need to
be worked out, but view is to mark to COO execution deal by deal, and only adjust down if a deal is under-water (no deal
marks up). Carry will also begin to recognized. Note: deals would be marked, not postions assuming liquidation (which
would be more volatile but not reflect actual business actvily).
4. Business flows will continue· buy and securitize loans, ramp and execute COOs. With exira focus on cleaning out left
over positions.
5. Platform opportunities are coming.
