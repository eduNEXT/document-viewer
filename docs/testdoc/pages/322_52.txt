Do we have dry powder? This builds a basis risk.
I like it a lot as a customer trade - i.e. we package our short with longs on an order
basis and we really reduce risk.
What is the overhang of aaa? What happens if they are downgraded? How much comes out, how
cheap do they then get?

Potential large subprime trade and impact on Firmwide VAR
- The mortgage department thinks there is currently an extraordinary opportunity for
those with dry powder to add AAA subprime risk in either cash or synthetic form.
- We would like to be opportunistic buyers of up to $10Bln subprime AAAs in either
cash or synthetic (ABX) form and run that long against our $3.581n in mezzanine subprime
shorts.
- Mortgage dept VAR would be reduced by $75mrn and Firmwide VAR would be reduced by
$25mm.
- At current dollar prices, the implied losses at the AAA level are 2.5x higher than
the implied losses at the BBB level where we have our shorts (the ratio is even cheaper
for cash due to technicals).
If ~ were priced consistent with BBB implied loss levels,
they would be trading 5-10pts higher in synthetics and lO-15pts higher in cash.
- On the supply side, we think we can source these assets from SIVs, SlY-lites, ABCP
Conduits, Sec Lenders, total return accounts.
- On the demand side, we plan to share this trade quietly with selected risk
partners. We began doing so yesterday when we sold 1/3 of the AAAs purchased off the
Solent list to Hayman Capital, and 100% of the AAAs from Cairn to MetWest and WAMCO.
