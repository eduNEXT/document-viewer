Improvement on FDI and seasonality
There should be a yoy improvement as the FDI export capacity comes online (the
deficit in January 2006 was SKK a.lbn). Seasonality also helps the figure, January
deficits are typically small. Because of the volatility of the trade data, there would
need to be more good months to gauge the extent of the improvement.

Oil and fresh food drive inflation down to 1%

Actual: +0.2% mom, 1.2% yoy

*
Good suprise mainly due to oil and fresh food prices which have fallen steeply,
partly due to good weather conditions. Core inflation possibly down a notch to 1.3% (HICP
basis)
*
Month after month, the inflation picture is proving even more benign than expected.
Inflation looks likley to remain well below 1.5% in 2007 and to reaccelerate smoothly in
2008

Worse than expected outcome on profit repatriation
The focus is going to be on profit repatriation. We expect an outflow of CZK 10bn on
the income line, which will contribute in our view the lower than expected surplus. The
current account balance has deteriorated recently, and the currency is burdened by
negative carry. We think it should weaken in the short run, especially if the appetite for
it as a funding currency in carry trades is maintained.
