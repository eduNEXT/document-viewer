on Tuesday, responded to a report on the firm's trading activities, showing that – in one day -- the firm
netted over $50 million by taking short positions that increased in valued as the mortgage market
cratered. Mr. Viniar wrote: “Tells you what might be happening to people who don't have the big
short.” Levin said: “There it is, in their own words: Goldman Sachs taking ‘the big short’ against the
mortgage market.”
In a third email, Goldman employees discussed the ups and downs of securities that were
underwritten and sold by Goldman and tied to mortgages issued by Washington Mutual Bank's
subprime lender, Long Beach Mortgage Company. Reporting the “wipeout” of one Long Beach
security and the “imminent” collapse of another as “bad news” that would cost the firm $2.5 million, a
Goldman Sachs employee then reported the “good news” – that the failure would bring the firm $5
million from a bet it had placed against the very securities it had assembled and sold.
In a fourth email, a Goldman Sachs manager reacted to news that the credit rating agencies had
downgraded $32 billion in mortgage related securities – causing losses for many investors – by noting
that Goldman had bet against them: “Sounds like we will make some serious money.” His colleague
responded: “Yes we are well positioned.”
Prior hearings of the Subcommittee have looked at how high risk lending strategies, bank
regulatory failures, and inflated credit ratings contributed to the financial crisis. Next Tuesday’s
hearing examining the role of investment banks will be the final hearing in the quartet of hearings on
“Wall Street and the Financial Crisis.”
The hearing will begin at 10:00 a.m. in room 106 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. There
will be a press briefing to preview the hearing at 11:00 a.m. Monday, April 26, in room 485 of the
Russell Senate Office Building.
