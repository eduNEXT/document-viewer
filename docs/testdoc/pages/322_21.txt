That volatility continued into the summer of 2007, as Bill McMahon, then COO & Head of Risk
Management for the Securities Division, communicated to Gary Cohn and David Viniar in an
email on August 15, 2007:
The volatilities and correlations among our assets are really driving the swings in
var right now. Robert Berry [the firm‘s Chief Market Risk Officer] sent out a
note last night indicating that the sensitivity of our var models to correlations
suggests that the var can swing between 140 and 160 without any changes in the
complexion of our trading books – essentially, it is noise. The only solution is to
reduce the size of the books, which is what we are working on with mortgages
and credit trading.29

The Effect of Goldman Sachs‘ Risk Management on Our Profits and Losses During the
Financial Crisis

Given the deteriorating performance of the mortgage market in 2007 and 2008 and the
corresponding decline in the value of mortgage-related products, the best and most relevant proof
of whether Goldman Sachs had a large net short position is our actual revenues in mortgages.
The relative consistency of revenues underlines the firm‘s on-going market making activities and
prudent risk management– not a massive proprietary, directional view of where the market might
have been headed.
The firm‘s mortgage-related positions had a relatively small effect on our net revenues or profits
for fiscal year 2007. The firm had net revenues of less than $500 million from our residential
mortgage-related products business in 2007. During fiscal year 2008, the firm had net losses of
approximately $1.7 billion related to our residential mortgage-related products business.
