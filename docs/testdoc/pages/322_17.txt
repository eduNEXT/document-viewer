Gary Cohn, the firm‘s President and Chief Operating Officer, remarked in a
March 6, 2007 e-mail that ―A big plus would hurt the Mortgage business but
Justin thinks he has a big trade lined up for the morning to get us out of a bunch
of our short risk[.]‖9



Dan Sparks noted on March 8, 2007 that ―Aside from the counterparty risks, the
large risks I worry about are… [c]overing our shorts. We have longs against
them, but we are still net short.‖10

On March 14, 2007, Tom Montag told Lloyd Blankfein that the firm ―[c]overed
another 1.2 billion in shorts in mortgages – almost flat – now need to reduce
risk[.]‖11

On April 11, 2007, Mr. Sparks received an estimate of the mortgage department‘s
exposure to certain products and noted to Kevin Gasvoda, a member of the
department: ―Subprime down 3mm from shorts? Is that right and are we too
short?‖ Mr. Gasvoda replied: ―Yes. Subprime has near zero loans and is short
some mez abx and $2B aaa abx[.] [T]he aaa short is painful . . . . Plan is to chip
away at covering on every chance.‖12

During this period, the mortgage department covered more than $2.8 billion in single-name short
positions. Even though these short positions proved profitable when viewed in isolation, this
meaningfully reduced the firm‘s net exposure to subprime residential mortgages by several
billion dollars -- in effect, getting the firm closer to home. In addition, by March, the firm‘s net
long exposure to prime and other residential mortgages had grown as a result of meeting client
needs in the mortgage market.
C. Different Views In The Firm
In the spring of 2007, there was continued debate amongst senior managers about the direction of
the residential mortgage market.13 For instance, on March 14, Jon Winkelried e-mailed Mr.
Sparks, and others, indicating that the firm should be prepared for a downturn in the performance
of securities backed by prime loans and asked what it was doing to insulate itself from losses. 14
Mr. Sparks replied: ―Trying to be smaller… We are also short a bunch of sub-prime AAA index
for jump risk protection.‖15
