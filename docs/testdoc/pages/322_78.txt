RE: Mortgages today

Bad news everywhere. Novastar (another subprime originator) bad earnings and 1/3 of market
cap gone immediately. Wells laying off 300+ sUbprime staff and home price appreciaiton
data showed for first time lower prices on homes over year broad based. Index over 100
wider last week and this week. CDOs starting to widen.
We are net short, but mostly in single name COS and some tranched index vs the some index
longs. We are working to cover more, but liquidity makes i t tough. Volatility is causing
our VAR numbers to grow dramatically.
