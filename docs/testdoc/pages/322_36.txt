Subject: Originator exposures
Rich and I were catching up. I will send this group another message of our potential large
risk areas as further stress happens, and our mitigation plans.
As for the big 3 originators - Accredited, New Century and Fremont,

our real exposure is
in the form of put-back claims. Basically, if we get nothing back we would lose around
$60mm vs our loans on our books (we have a reserve of $30mm) and the loans in the trusts
could lose around $60mm (we probably suffer about 1/3 of this in ongoing exposures). The
reason it is not clear is that the loans are not worth 0, there is some value, so there
are estimates as to what happens on those loans.
Rumor today is that the FBI is in Accredited.
Other big risk areas I will discuss later relate to CDO and loan execution (rating agency
or market shutdown), covering single name and index shorts (liquidity), and retained
residuals and loan positions (if collateral performance turns worse).
