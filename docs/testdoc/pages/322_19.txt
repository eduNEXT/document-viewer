In late August, the mortgage department again purchased $350 million in triple-B ABX and
covered $150 million in single-name shorts. Without greater clarity on the direction of the
housing market, the firm sought to maintain a balanced position in the subprime mortgage
market. A mortgage presentation to the Board of Directors, dated September 17, 2007, shows
the subprime mortgage position on a notional basis and indicates a substantially balanced
position.21
D. End of 2007/Beginning of 2008
On November 18, 2007 Lucas van Praag, global head of Corporate Communications, sent an email to Lloyd Blankfein and Gary Cohn about a New York Times article suggesting that Goldman
Sachs profited on the subprime market collapse.22 Mr. Blankfein responded, ―Of course we
didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of
shorts. Also, it‘s not over, so who knows how it will turn out ultimately.‖23 Mr. Cohn qualified,
―We were just smaller in the toxic products.‖24
A November 2007 document entitled ―How Did GS Avoid the Mortgage Crisis,‖ prepared for
David Viniar in advance of earnings conference calls, summarized the firm‘s position following
our prudent risk reduction efforts. After outlining the actions in late 2006 and early 2007, the
document states:
However, one should not be lead [sic] to believe that we went through this period
unscathed and somehow significantly profited from a ‗bet‘ on the downturn in
mortgage markets. The actions that I outlined led to significant write downs in
the value of our long mortgage inventory over the course of this year. We
mentioned during our second quarter conference call that a weak quarter in
Mortgages contributed to lower results in our FICC businesses. A better
characterization of the situation is that we effectively avoided greater losses by
taking these proactive steps and in fact during the third quarter we were able to
make money on mortgages as a result of our net short position.25
By November 30, 2007, Goldman Sachs‘ net exposure to subprime residential mortgages was
balanced. The firm‘s prime and other residential mortgage exposure continued to be long cash
instruments of approximately $13.5 billion.
