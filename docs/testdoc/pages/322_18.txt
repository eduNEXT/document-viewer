Richard Ruzika, a senior Securities Division partner, on the other hand, replied:
It does feel to me like the market in general underestimated how bad it could get.
And now could be overestimating where we are heading. . . . While undoubtedly
there will be some continued spillover, I‘m not so convinced this is a total death
spiral. In fact, we may have terrific opportunities. Dan‘s team is working hard
(literally around the clock) so we have a shot at them . . . .16
As Mr. Ruzika‘s e-mail indicates, Goldman Sachs carefully monitored our short positions and
explored the possibility of increasing long positions and other opportunities in the mortgage
markets if market conditions appeared favorable. The firm even explored the possibility of
buying interests in, or pools of assets from, subprime originators. In a March 9, 2007 e-mail that
Gary Cohn subsequently forwarded to Lloyd Blankfein, Dan Sparks discussed potential
investments that the firm might make in subprime originators.17 The firm also continued to
respond to client requests to sell mortgage securities and submit bids on long positions. Various
bids were accepted by clients, and the firm took on additional long risk.
In the third quarter of 2007, the subprime mortgage market deteriorated further. As David Viniar
stated in the third quarter earnings conference call, ―The mortgage sector continues to be
challenged and there is a broad decline in the value of mortgage inventories during the quarter.
As a result, we took significant markdowns on our long inventory positions during the quarter as
we had in the previous two quarters. However, our risk bias from that market was to be short and
that net short position was profitable.‖18 The firm, however, did not amass a large net short
position to ―bet against the housing market.‖ For the quarter, the firm‘s net revenues from
residential mortgage-related activities were less than 5% of its total revenues.
Some in Goldman Sachs‘ mortgage business began to argue that the firm should consider buying
more mortgage assets, believing that prices may have bottomed. For example:

In an e-mail on August 20, 2007, Mr. Sparks told Mr. Winkelried (and others) that
―We think it is now time to start using balance sheet and it is a unique opportunity
with real upside—specifically for AAA RMBS.‖ Mr. Sparks also said that he was
going to devise a ―plan describing the opportunity and parameters (including
funding and risk) relating to buying billions.‖19
In an August 21, 2007 e-mail, Josh Birnbaum told Tom Montag and others, ―The
mortgage department thinks there is currently an extraordinary opportunity for
those with dry powder to add AAA subprime risk in either cash or synthetic
form.‖20
