The firm also employed internal and third-party resources to conduct due diligence on the
individual loans in the pools backing the securities in our RMBS offerings, including reviewing
selected loan files, verifying compliance with state and federal lending statutes, and selective
review of property appraisals against comparable values. As a result, Goldman Sachs generally
did not accept loans that, based on our review and analysis, appeared to have potentially
significant legal, regulatory compliance or other issues. Knowing what we know today, of
course, we wish we had done even more.
Regardless of the degree of due diligence performed by underwriters in connection with RMBS
securitizations, however, they cannot and do not guarantee payment, performance or any rate of
return. Rather, it is up to the purchaser of securities to evaluate whether the securities are worthy
of investment based on the purchaser‘s own view and analysis of the securities‘ value in light of
the purchaser‘s expectations about the future of the housing market and the economy.
Importantly, in the case of asset-backed securities, the disclosures set forth in the firm‘s offering
documents included detailed descriptions of the underlying assets.
Goldman Sachs‘ Position in the Residential Mortgage and CDO Markets

IV.

Goldman Sachs certainly was not the dominant participant in the residential mortgage securities
underwriting market. The firm entered this market space relatively late, with a small amount of
customer activity and without a significant mortgage origination business.
