As it's often the case, an unexpected figure, despite having most of the national
data beforehand. This time most of the surprise can be tracked down to Ireland, where
industrial output jumped almost 20%mom, adding 0.4% to growth in the whole Euro area.
Strong growth in Italy, +2.0%mom, and France, 1.1%, were released last Friday and more
than offset the German contraction (-0.6%mom). On 3-month/3-month basis, Euroland
industrial production was up 0.4%, down from +O.9%qoq in Q3. Germany and France were about
flat while Italy was up 1.6~ and Spain +1.0~. There are some signs that point to weak
industrial data in coming months: the manufacturing PMI has fallen, if moderately, in the
last three months; foreign orders for German output has been flat recently; the VAT will
probably induce some weakness; and our Global Leading Indicator, which has in the past
signalled the direction of the area's PMI, has been showing weaker momentum for some
months. Some businesses may take their chance to replenish their inventories but, overall,
final demand developmensts should dominate.

Continuing signs of a strong external position
The mild weather may have increased imports into the booming construction sector,
which means that there is a slight upside risk on the trade balance side. On the financing
side we expect strong FOI inflows to continue. The PLN has been struggling recently
despite the very favourable external position, but we think that has to do with the low
carry rather than the underlying fundamentals. We expect the currency to strengthen
significantly over the following one year.

Increase on food prices
We are expecting somewhat higher food inflation than in January, and a still fairly
supportive fuel price contribution. The change of CPI weights should not have a large
impact on the outcome. Going forward, we expect a gradual increase in underlying
inflation, but this will not be apparent in the summer months because of the favourable
base effect. We expect a 100 bps of hikes in the next 12 months from the NBP, which is not
fully priced.
