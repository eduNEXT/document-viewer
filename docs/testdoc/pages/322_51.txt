Big Oppo,tunity

live are seeing large liquidations - we bought $350mm AAA subprime RMBS from Solent and Cairn SIV unwinds today
with prices ranging from 77 to 94 (depending on the bond specifics) - these levels price cumulative losses around 35%
while A8X B88- price cum losses in the low-to-mid teens. This is liquidity, fear and technically driven. We are also
getting frequent calls from originators who need to sell loans - most recent is $1 aBS from CIT.
We ttlink it is now time to start using balance si1eet and it is a unique opportunity with real upside - specifically for AAA
RMBS. We've sold over $100mm of what we bought today - most up1-2 points.
That's a great trade - buy and flip up 1-2 points, however, we're not always going to be able to that - and there's the
opportunity for us to make 5-10+ points if we have a longer term hold.
I spoke with Don and Tom this morning, and we are going to come back to them with a specific plan describing Ule
opportunity and parameters (including funding and risk) relating to buying billions.
This is consistent with our view that the .A.AA ABX index is a great opportunity and we continue to like it.
