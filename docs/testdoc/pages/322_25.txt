Yes. We spent about two hours together. Dan and team did a very gcxx:l jOb going through the risks. On ABX, the position
is reasonably sensible but is just too big. Might have to spend a little to size it appropriately. On everything else my basic
message was let's be aggressive distributing things because there will be very good opportunities as the markets goes
into what is likely to be even greater distress and we want to be in position to take advantage of them.
let me know if you want 10 catch up live.

Subprime risk meeting with Viniar/McMahon Summary

Mortgage team - Gasvoda, Rosenblum, Swenson and me.
Viniar, Bill, Brian lee (controllers) and some risk guys.
Ruzika on phone.
Reviewed in detail 6 areas of risk related to subprime:

ABXlCDS
Loans
Residuals
COO warehouse
Early Payment Defaults (EPDs)
Loan warehouse
Follow-ups:
1. Reduce exposure, sell more ABX index outright, basis trade of index vs COS tao large
2. Distribute as much as possible on bonds created from new loan securitizations and clean previous positions
3. Sell some more resids
4. Mark the COO warehouse more regularly (had been policy to true-up quarterly) - will likely be weekly or more
if necessary
5. Stay focused on the credit of the originators we buy loans from and lend to
6. Slay focused and aggressive on MLN (warehouse customer and originator we have EPDs to that is likely to
fail)
7. Be ready for the good opportunities that are coming (keep powder dry and look around the market hard)
